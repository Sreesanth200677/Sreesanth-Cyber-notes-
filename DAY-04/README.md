What is a Network?
A network refers to a group of devices—such as computers, routers, servers, and other hardware—that are connected to share data and resources. These connections enable communication between devices, whether they’re within the same room or across the globe. Networks can range from simple setups involving just two connected computers to vast systems like the Internet, which interconnects billions of devices worldwide.

Understanding Subnets
A subnet, or subnetwork, is a smaller segment of a larger IP network. It helps in organizing and managing big networks by breaking them into more manageable parts. Subnetting is used to improve overall network performance, reduce congestion from broadcast traffic, and enhance security by isolating sections of a network.

What is Port Forwarding?
Port forwarding is a method used in networking to direct traffic from an external source to a specific device and port number within a private network. It's commonly used to make internal services, such as a web server or gaming server, accessible from the internet. By setting up port forwarding, network administrators can allow external devices to communicate with internal services securely and efficiently.

Antivirus and Encrypted Files
While antivirus programs are crucial for detecting and blocking threats, they usually can’t scan password-protected or encrypted files. This limitation means that malicious content hidden inside encrypted ZIP files or locked documents might evade detection. Therefore, users should be cautious when opening files that require passwords, especially from unknown or untrusted sources. Using additional layers of security, such as behavioral monitoring and endpoint protection, can help mitigate these risks.

User Account Control (UAC) in Windows
User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism in Windows designed to prevent unauthorized changes to the system. It does this by prompting users for permission or administrator credentials when software attempts to make system-level changes. UAC helps prevent malware from altering important settings or installing harmful software without user consent. Depending on the setting, UAC can notify the user every time, only when apps make changes, or not at all—though disabling it is not recommended.

Have I Been Pwned? (HIBP)
"Have I Been Pwned?" is a free online tool that lets users check if their email addresses or passwords have been exposed in known data breaches. Created by cybersecurity expert Troy Hunt, the platform allows individuals and organizations to monitor their personal data and receive alerts if it's found in leaked databases. The site also includes features for checking domains and searching for breached credentials across public paste sites, making it a valuable tool for protecting online accounts.

Wayback Machine: Internet Time Travel
The Wayback Machine is an online service by the Internet Archive that stores snapshots of web pages over time. This allows users to see what a website looked like in the past, retrieve deleted content, or view older versions of web pages that have since changed. With hundreds of billions of archived pages dating back to 1996, it’s a powerful resource for research, digital forensics, and content recovery.

What is an API?
An Application Programming Interface, or API, is a set of rules that allows different software systems to communicate with each other. APIs define how requests are made, how data is formatted, and what responses are expected. There are several types of APIs, such as REST, GraphQL, SOAP, and WebSockets. APIs are commonly used to integrate external services, connect mobile apps to servers, or build scalable, modular applications.

What is a .env File?
A .env file is a configuration file used to store environment variables. These variables typically include sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, or application settings. Using a .env file helps keep this data separate from the main codebase, making the application easier to configure for different environments (like development or production). It’s best practice to exclude .env files from version control to prevent accidental leaks.

Nmap Flags for Network Scanning
Nmap is a popular tool used for scanning and auditing networks. It includes a variety of command-line flags to perform different types of scans. For example, the -A flag enables advanced features like OS and version detection, while -sS performs a stealthy TCP SYN scan. Nmap can be used to scan specific ports, check for vulnerabilities, and save results in readable formats. It's widely used in cybersecurity assessments, particularly in environments like Kali Linux.

TCP vs. UDP: Key Differences
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two core communication protocols. TCP is connection-oriented, ensuring that data is delivered reliably and in the correct order. This makes it ideal for applications like web browsing, email, and file transfers. UDP, on the other hand, is faster but doesn’t guarantee delivery or order, which makes it better suited for streaming media, online games, or DNS lookups where speed matters more than reliability.

When to Choose TCP or UDP
TCP should be used when data accuracy and order are critical—such as in banking systems or websites. UDP is preferred in scenarios where speed is more important than reliability, like in video conferencing, online gaming, or real-time broadcasting. Choosing the right protocol depends on the needs of the application and the tolerance for data loss or delays.

IPv4 vs. IPv6
IPv4 and IPv6 are both versions of the Internet Protocol used to assign addresses to devices. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, which limits the number of possible addresses to around 4.3 billion. IPv6, with its 128-bit structure, offers a nearly limitless number of unique addresses, making it essential for future growth and IoT devices. IPv6 also includes improvements in routing, security (with built-in IPsec), and automatic configuration, though IPv4 remains widely used for legacy compatibility.

MAC Address Overview
A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a hardware identifier assigned to network interfaces. It consists of 48 bits, usually displayed in hexadecimal format. Each device’s MAC address is designed to be unique, helping routers and switches recognize them on a local network. While MAC addresses are essential for network communication, they can be spoofed, and they offer limited security by themselves.
